For each record in the input dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Output data set (tidy_data): 
- The training data set and test data set is merged.
- Each row represents an activity of a subject who carried out the experiment, as identified by the columns activity and subject. 
- Mean and standard deviation for each subject and activity is being captured on different features, as indicated by the columns of time and frequency domain.
